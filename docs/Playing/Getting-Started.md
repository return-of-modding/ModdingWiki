## Using r2modman on Windows

[This](https://lethal.wiki/installation/installing-r2modman) is a guide made for Lethal Company but it’s pretty good so just pretend it’s for RoRR.

## Using r2modman on Linux

- Run the game at least once, to make sure steam generates the wineprefix. Doesn't have to fully launch or anything, steam just has to try launching the executable.

- Steam Deck Only: Be in desktop mode and maybe find a keyboard and mouse.

- Download the latest r2modman app image from this [link](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/)

- Select RORR and download the mods you like.

- Set the launch options to `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="version=n,b" %command%`

- You can also add the launch option in r2modman to open the modded game directly from steam right after.

- Go into the steam game's properties and force it to use Proton Experimental in the compatibility tab. (you can find out steps for that [here](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck))

- You should be able to open the game from either r2modman or directly from RORR if you included those launch options after the `WINEDLLOVERRIDES`.
