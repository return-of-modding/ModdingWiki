Compatible Mod Managers All \"major\" thunderstore mod managers should work with Risk of Rain Returns: r2modman (v3.1.50 and above only!) Gale Mod Manager (v1.2.1 and above only!) Thunderstore Mod Manager Some mods doesn't work after an update The modding toolkit and the mod loader itself are still in beta, there may be breaking changes and older mods may not work after either update, sorry! Using r2modman on Windows This is a guide made for Lethal Company but it\u2019s pretty good so just pretend it\u2019s for RoRR. Using r2modman on Linux Run the game at least once, to make sure steam generates the wineprefix. Doesn't have to fully launch or anything, steam just has to try launching the executable. Steam Deck Only: Be in desktop mode and maybe find a keyboard and mouse. Download the latest r2modman app image from this link Select RORR and download the mods you like. Set the launch options to WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"version=n,b\" %command% You can also add the launch option in r2modman to open the modded game directly from steam right after. Go into the steam game's properties and force it to use Proton Experimental in the compatibility tab. (you can find out steps for that here ) You should be able to open the game from either r2modman or directly from RORR if you included those launch options after the WINEDLLOVERRIDES .","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"Playing/Getting-Started/#getting-started","text":"If you still have an issue after following this guide, feel free to ask for support in the Return of Modding Discord .","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"Playing/Getting-Started/#compatible-mod-managers","text":"All \"major\" thunderstore mod managers should work with Risk of Rain Returns: r2modman (v3.1.50 and above only!)
